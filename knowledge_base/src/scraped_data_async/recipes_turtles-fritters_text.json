    "1/2 tsp salt",
    "1/2 cup milk",
    "1 tbsp butter, melted",
    "1 tbsp lemon juice",
    "2 tbsp icing sugar",
    "Instructions",
    "Pour oil into large, heavy-bottomed pot and set over medium heat. Attach a candy thermometer to side of pan, ensuring it does not touch the bottom. Heat until oil reaches 375ÂºF.",
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together 3/4 cup flour, baking soda and salt. Whisk in milk, butter and lemon juice just until combined.",
    "In a small bowl, toss MINI TURTLES with remaining flour until well coated. Insert a wooden skewer into a TURTLES Mini and dip in batter; shake off excess. Carefully lower into hot oil; use another wooden skewer to release fritter into oil. Cook 4 pieces at a time, using tongs or a wooden spoon to rotate fritters, for 2 or 3 minutes or until golden brown. Adjust heat to maintain oil temperature if necessary.",
    "Use a slotted spoon to transfer fritters to a paper towel-lined tray; let cool slightly. Dust with icing sugar before serving.",
