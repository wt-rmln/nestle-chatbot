    "This delicious recipe is inspired by the Huron-Wendat’s (and other Indigenous communities) cultural use and understanding of maple trees, its sap, and the traditional methods of processing used to create one of Canada’s most loved and well-known condiment – maple syrup. This sweet and interactive snack is now a popular attraction at sugar shacks (or cabane à sucre) across the country during harvest season.",

    "Indulge in a family-friendly, Filipino inspired treat that’s as easy to whip up as it is delicious. These no-bake, bite-sized delights are ideal for summer days when you want to avoid turning on the oven. Made with the rich and chocolatey flavour of MILO, each piece is a sweet, chewy and creamy treat.",
