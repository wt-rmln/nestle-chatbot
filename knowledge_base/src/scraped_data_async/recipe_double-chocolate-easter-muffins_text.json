    "75g Dutch Cocoa Powder",
    "1 Eggs",
    "100g Brown Sugar",

    "Pour wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined, about twelve times. Fold in the smarties.",
    "Spray the muffin cups with cooking spray - or use vegetable oil to grease them. Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups using a 1/3 measure, and place in the oven",
    "After 5 minutes, turn down the oven temperature to 375 and bake for another 20min",
    "Once baked, let cool in the muffin tray for 5 minutes, and then on a cooling rack until completely cool.",
    "When you are ready to serve, turn oven to broil setting and place the muffins on a baking tray. Put one marshmallow on each muffin and broil for one minute. Take the muffins out of the oven and gently push down on the marshmallow with a spoon. Place a KitKat Easter bunny on top and serve.",

    "Checking for doneness",
    "Insert a toothpick into a muffin, if it comes out clean, they are ready!",
    "Broil Alternative",
    "If your oven doesn’t have a broil setting, leave the muffins and marshmallows in a warm oven until the marshmallow softens",
