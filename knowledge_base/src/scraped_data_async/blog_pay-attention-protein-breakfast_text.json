    "If your idea of breakfast is a cup of coffee, you may want to rethink your morning meal. We’ve all heard the saying thatbreakfastis the most important meal of the day, but why? Research showsskipping breakfast is associated with nutrient gaps, including calcium, iron, fibre and vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, C and D, and these important nutrients commonly consumed at breakfast are not made up later in the day. Not only does a good breakfast break your overnight fast and get your day up and running, but it’s also good for you.",
    "The Right Mix for a Nutrient-packed Breakfast",
    "Done right, a good breakfast will include foods that satisfy your hunger for at least 2-3 hours, keeping you full until your next meal or between-meal snack. It should include a mix of carbohydrates, which give you energy to fuel your body, plus proteins to support muscle and immune health.",
    "The Power of Protein",
    "Protein is particularly important at breakfast time. That’s because unlike carbohydrates and fats, your body can’t store extra protein – so itworks best if protein is spread out throughout the day, starting with breakfast. Keeping protein-rich foods and protein drinks on hand, likeBOOST® SIMPLY + Vanilla Nutrition Drink, to have as a snack or to help round out a nutrient-packed breakfast helps you reach your protein target each day.",
    "Most people pile on the protein at dinner, with steak or chicken at the center of the plate. Ideally, we should be spreading out our protein intake across every meal and snack throughout the day, aiming for about 20-35g protein each meal. Check outCanada's Food Guidefor what makes up a healthy food plate.",
    "Older adultsneed to pay extra attention to protein, since we need more of it than we did when we were younger. For example, a healthy 65-year-old weighing 150 pounds needs at least 75 grams of protein per day, compared to 55 grams of protein for an adult in their twenties, weighing the same. (Learn more about your individual needshere.)",
    "Five Protein-Packed Breakfast Ideas",
    "There is a nutrient-packed breakfast for everyone, whether you have time for a sit-down meal or need something quick to take on the go. Here are five protein breakfast ideas that will satisfy your stomach and tantalize your taste buds:",
    "Make a Protein Shake. The ultimate easy breakfast, ahigh-protein shakeis great when time is tight, and you have some produce that you need to use up. A high-speed blender is best, but a food processor or immersion blender can work just as well. Use milk or BOOST® High Protein Nutritional Drink as a liquid protein base, then add whatever fruits and/or vegetables you have on hand to give you some vitamins and minerals.",
    "Prepare Overnight Oats. Another easy breakfast option is one that you prep the night before. Preparing rolled oats with milk or BOOST® Nutritional Drink not only increases the protein but gives you extra flavor and creaminess. Add in whatever toppings or mix-ins you’d like. For a tasty treat that try this recipe forBOOST® High Protein Strawberries and Cream Overnight Oats",
    "Make a Yogurt Parfait. Another easy breakfast idea that requires little prep work is a cup of yogurt with chia seeds. Greek yogurt or Icelandic skyr options contain more protein than traditional yogurt. Add a topping of chia or pumpkin seeds for crunch and 3-4 grams of protein per two tablespoons. Top with some berries or sliced bananas for sweetness and extra nutrition",
    "Prepare High Protein Pancakes or Waffles. Whether you eat them fresh or make once to freeze and reheat later,this banana chocolate pancake recipeusingBOOST® High Protein Chocolate Nutritional Drinkadds protein and add some delicious, familiar flavours everyone will enjoy. Buckwheat flour is used in the base and gives these breakfast flapjacks extra fibre and texture.",
    "Make a Breakfast Sandwich. If a hot breakfast is what you crave, save a trip to the drive-through and make your own egg sandwich. Just toast an English muffin (you’ll get more fibre and a little more protein if it’s whole wheat) and cook up 1-2 eggs. Melt some cheese and add a slice of ham or turkey, and you’ve got a healthy breakfast in the palm of your hand!",
