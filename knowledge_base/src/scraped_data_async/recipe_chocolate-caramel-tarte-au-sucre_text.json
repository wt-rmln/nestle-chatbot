    "Chocolate Caramel Tarte au Sucre",
    "Inspired by traditional Quebecois cuisine, this ooey-gooey tart is a Canadian holiday classic. Originally made with just maple syrup for sweetness, as it was a common ingredient in the region, the recipe has been adapted over the years to include brown sugar as well. This modern version includes nutty Turtles chocolates and creamy Mackintosh Caramels for extra flavour, enhanced texture and added indulgence.",
