    "Through the Nestlé Cocoa Plan, we distribute higher-yielding, disease-resistant cocoa plants, train farmers in better agricultural practices, support women farmers and improve access to education for children.",
    "The Cocoa Plan is Nestlé’s way of helping to tackle key issues facing cocoa farmers, their  families and communities to create a better future for cocoa farming. By working closely with farming cooperatives and paying a premium for quality, we aim to reduce the complexity of the supply chain, improve returns to farmers and improve the quality of cocoa for Nestlé.",
    "While the Cocoa Plan is principally focused on Côte d’Ivoire, it also covers Nestlé’s global cocoa sourcing activities in South America, Indonesia and the whole West Africa region.",
    "Nestlé in Canada is proud to use only UTZ certified sustainable cocoa, sourced through the Cocoa Plan to craft some of the most loved products in Canada.",
    "We put tremendous effort into ensuring our products are made using quality ingredients sourced in a responsible way.",
