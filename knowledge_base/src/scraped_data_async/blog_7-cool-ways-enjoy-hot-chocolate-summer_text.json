    "1.Frozen Hot Chocolate",
    "Not quite ice cream but frostier than a milkshake, frozen hot chocolate tastes like a lighter version of those summertime classics with a chocolate twist. Just whip Carnation Hot Chocolate, milk and ice together in a blender until smooth. If you're looking for extra chocolatey flavour, add chocolate milk instead of plain milk or water. Non-dairy alternatives also work just as well.",
    "2. Iced Hot Chocolate",
    "Transform Carnation Hot Chocolate into a cool, creamy beverage. Simply make your hot chocolate as usual, let it cool slightly, and then pour over ice. Add a splash of milk or cream for extra richness. It's like your favourite chocolate milk but with the deep flavour of hot cocoa.",
    "3. Hot Chocolate Ice Pops",
    "Pour cooled Carnation Hot Chocolate into popsicle moulds, add a stick, and freeze. For a fun twist, layer with vanilla or strawberry yogurt for a Neapolitan effect. It's a perfect grab-and-go treat that will keep the kids cool and happy.",
    "4. Hot Chocolate Affogato",
    "For a grown-up treat, place a scoop ofHäagen-Dazsvanilla or chocolate ice cream in a bowl, and pour a shot of espresso mixed with a shot of cooled, concentrated Carnation Hot Chocolate over it. This twist on the classic affogato gives you the boldness of espresso coupled with the rich, comforting taste of chocolate, melting over the creamy ice cream for an indulgent, multi-textured dessert.",
    "5. Hot Chocolate Float",
    "Fill a tall glass halfway with chilled Carnation Hot Chocolate, then carefully add a scoop ofHäagen-Dazsice cream. As the ice cream melts, it creates a wonderfully creamy chocolate drink. Experiment with different ice cream flavours like coffee or salted caramel for a unique twist.",
