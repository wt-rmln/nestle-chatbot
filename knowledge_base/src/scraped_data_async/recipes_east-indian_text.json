    "A conversation about traditional Bengali cuisine can never be complete without Chingri-Malai Curry! ‘Chingri’ means prawn and ‘Malai’ means cream, but it’s the coconut milk in this recipe that gives it the creaminess and smooth texture. So, if you love seafood and are in the mood to have something delicious, this is a recipe you need to try!Some of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada. Therefore we encourage you wherever possible to find local alternative products. Nestlé Canada Inc. does not recommend using Nestlé products not for sale in Canada and is not liable for any injuries related to the purchase and consumption of these products."
