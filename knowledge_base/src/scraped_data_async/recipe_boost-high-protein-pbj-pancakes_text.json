    "1 bottle (237 mL) BOOST High Protein Vanilla",
    "2/3 cup all-purpose flour",
    "1/2 cup whole wheat flour",
    "1 1/2 tsp baking powder",
    "3/4 tsp baking soda",
    "pinch salt",

    "Instructions",
    "In large bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, whisk together BOOST® High Protein Vanilla, eggs, and peanut butter; pour over dry ingredients and whisk until combined but still slightly lumpy.",
    "Brush some of the oil in a large non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Scoop scant 1/4 cup (60 mL) batter into pan; spread slightly to form pancake. Repeat. Cook until bubbles appear on top, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until bottom is golden brown, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining batter, brushing the pan lightly with more oil. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet; cover and keep warm in 250°F (120°C) oven.",
    "Serve pancakes spread with jam. Garnish with fresh berries and a dusting of icing sugar.",
