    "Latin Burgers with Caramelized Onions",
    "Latin cuisine prides itself on the depth and diversity of flavors that result from using local and readily available ingredients. Latin food is sometimes known for being spicy, it’s true – but it’s also hearty, sweet, savory, refined, comforting, healthy, smoky, salty, and over-the-top delicious – just like this dish. These zesty burgers combine chorizo, a spicy jalapeño relish and Maggi Liquid Seasoning for a super-craveable Latin flavor explosion!Some of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada. Therefore we encourage you wherever possible to find local alternative products. Nestlé Canada Inc. does not recommend using Nestlé products not for sale in Canada and is not liable for any injuries related to the purchase and consumption of these products.",
