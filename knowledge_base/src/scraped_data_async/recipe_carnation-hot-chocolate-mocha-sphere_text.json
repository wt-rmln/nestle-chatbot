    "Ingredients",
    "Preparation",
    "2 cups of chocolate (70% cocoa or higher)",
    "1tsp Carnation Hot Chocolate",
    "1tsp Nescafé instant coffee",
    "Sprinkles",
    "100ml Milk",
    "Small Marshmallows",
    "Instructions",
    "Melting Dark Chocolate",
    "Start by melting dark chocolate in a bowl over hot water. You can do this by placing the bowl over hot water on the stove, stirring until chocolate is completely melted.",
    "Filling the Mold",
    "Once the chocolate has melted, carefully scoop a teaspoon at a time into the mold. Make sure to fill each cavity of the mold evenly.",
    "Chill in Fridge",
    "Place the mold in the fridge to allow the chocolate to set and harden. This should take approximately 5 minutes to cool off.",
    "Remove chocolate from mold",
    "After the chocolate has hardened, take the mold out of the fridge. Gently pop the chocolate out of the mold, being careful not to break it.",
    "Filling the Chocolate Sphere",
    "Take one half of the chocolate sphere and fill it with mini marshmallows, 25g of Carnation Hot chocolate, and 1 teaspoon of your favourite Nescafé instant coffee.",
    "Melting and Binding Chocolate",
    "Heat up a frying pan and once hot, place an empty hemisphere on top with the dome side up. Once it begins to melt, remove and connect to the filled hemisphere. The melted chocolate will allow the two hemispheres to bind.",
    "Brush with Chocolate",
    "Take the remainder of melted hot chocolate and with a small brush go over the lining where the hemispheres connect to make sure it's fully connected.",
    "Decorate Chocolate Sphere",
    "Let your creativity shine! Decorate your chocolate sphere with drizzles of melted chocolate, sprinkles, or any other toppings you like.",
    "Warm Milk Preparation",
    "Prepare a warm glass of milk.",
    "Enjoying the Mocha Drink",
    "Lastly, place the chocolate sphere into the warm glass of milk. Sit back and watch as the sphere slowly melts, releasing its delicious contents into the milk. Stir gently to combine the flavours, and then enjoy your delightful and decadent mocha drink!",
    "Tips",
    "If you want to temper your chocolate which would give it the hard, glossy look and brittle snap when broken: Melt 2/3 of your dark chocolate to a temperature of 46-48 degrees Celsius then remove from the heat and add the last 1/3 of the dark chocolate, while rapidly stirring and cooling it down to 28-30 Celsius.",
    "The mold",
    "Depending on the size of the mold you have, you can adjust the recipe to more or less of the ingredients.",
    "To speed up the melting process",
    "To speed up the melting process once served, you can use a spoon or a hand frother.",
