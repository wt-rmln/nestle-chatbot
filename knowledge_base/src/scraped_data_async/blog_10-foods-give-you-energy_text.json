    "Life is just so exciting – playing with kids, exercising, planning get-togethers. We need plenty of energy to do all the things we love!",
    "There are bound to be days when we feel like we could use more energy. Maybe we didn’t sleep well the night before, or we’re coming down with a cold. Or it could be because of what we’ve been eating and drinking.Nutrition to Fuel Your Body",
    "So, what is it that gives us energy? Of course, we know that caffeinated beverages and shots provide the feeling of quick energy, but what we really need is sustained energy – that is, energy from foods that fuel the cells of the body and keep us going strong.  Specific nutrients to focus on include:",
    "Carbohydrates, which can give you quick energy (think: sugar) or long-lasting energy (whole grains and fiber-rich foods).",
    "Fat,which provides slower-burning energy.",
    "B vitaminsthat help unlock the energy potential of carbohydrates, fat and protein",
    "Protein,to provide building blocks for your muscles and other tissues, help keep your body working well and for sustained energy - just to name a few of its functions.",
    "10 Nutrient-packed Foods to Help Fuel Nutritional EnergyKnowing the nutrients that contribute to energy levels is great, but how does this translate to the actual foods we eat? Here’s a list of what you can keep on hand to help deliver those energy-fueling nutrients:1.Bananas– If you’ve ever been to a road race, you know that bananas are a runner’s favourite food, both for pre-workout and recovery. That’s because bananas have a good mix of starch (slow-burning carbs) and sugar (quick-burning carbs). Bananas are also a source of vitamin B6, potassium and vitamin C.2.Pasta– Another favourite dish of athletes, pasta provides complex, starchy carbohydrates to give you sustainable energy plus fibre if you select whole grain choices. You’ll also get a variety of B vitamins and iron.3.Avocados– These green fruits (yes, they’re a fruit!) provide healthy fats and fibre, as well as pantothenic acid, a B vitamin that helps convert food to energy.4. Nuts– When it comes to protein, carbs and fat, nuts have it all. The fat in nuts is unsaturated, meaning it’s more heart-healthy. You also get a good amount of fiber, B vitamins, iron and magnesium.5.Salmon– Fish is a great source of protein, and salmon especially provides heart-healthy omega-3 fats and vitamins B3 (niacin), B6 and B12.6.Yogurt– Yogurt is made by fermenting milk using healthy bacteria to give it a versatile, thicker texture. Dairy-based yogurt is an excellent source of protein, vitamins B2 (riboflavin) and B12, and a good source of magnesium.7.Breakfast cereal– Ready-to-eat cereal has been a staple at breakfast for generations, probably because it is a convenient way to get you going for the day. Grains such as wheat, rice or corn tend to serve as the main ingredient in cereal, so you get energy-enhancing carbohydrates. Choosing whole-grain and lower-sugar cereal options will help keep your energy levels steady. Most breakfast cereal is also fortified with iron, B vitamins, magnesium and other nutrients.8.Oatmeal– Oats are a great way to start the day. They’re a naturally good source of carbohydrates and fiber, and they’re loaded with B vitamins like thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), B6, and folate (B9). Have you ever thought of preparing them as a savoury dish? Oats are a great base for additions like eggs, cheese, kimchi, curry, chili – the sky is the limit! If you prefer traditional oatmeal and want to up the protein in your oatmeal breakfast, make it with milk instead of water.9.Legumes– Beans and pulses of all types are economical and versatile bundles of protein, complex carbohydrates and fibre.  Explore a variety of dishes from around the world using legumes and you may just find your next favourite, nutritious meal!10.BOOST® Nutritional Drink– When you want a variety of nutrients in one convenient serving*, BOOST® nutritional drinks are great option. As well as giving you protein, BOOST® beverages contain B vitamins to help convert food to energy and nutrient-rich calories that give you the nutritional energy you need to help you be your best.Find all these energy-boosting foods and beverages at your local grocery store. Look for BOOST® in the nutritional foods section of your local retailer.",
