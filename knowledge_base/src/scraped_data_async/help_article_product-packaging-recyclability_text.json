    "With recycling logos coming in all different formats and appearances, we know that it can be confusing to determine whether a product is recyclable or not.  We have 3 helpful suggestions:",
    "1. Look for the recycling symbol, the “mobius loop”, to determine if the pack is recyclable.  Check with your local municipality to see if the materials are recyclable in your region.",
    "2. Consult your packaging. Many packs will include recycling instructions on how to correctly dispose of packaging to aid with the recycling process. The packaging itself will have the most updated information.",
    "3. Re-purpose packaging wherever possible. Some of our packages can be re-purposed, like our iconic Quality Street tin and Nescafé Jar. We encourage you to find creative ways to do so!",
